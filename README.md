Prediction Of Heart Disease using ML

Developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk based on patient health data. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and ROC-AUC, providing insights for early diagnosis and prevention. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare applications.
